# Pool It Together - Team 1
## Introduction
For a swimming pool company, business is seasonal and with that comes unique challenges with project and inventory management. Retaining employees is difficult with the seasonal nature of the business, so they usually rely upon contractors to perform service work for customers. As a small mom and pop shop, having effective reporting tools in these often complex business structures is far and few between. Keeping track of swimming pool details for each customer, their past services and product purchases, and which contractor worked on those projects requires a lot of organization. Without connecting data sources, it will be difficult for managers to view the overall scope and functions within the business.

Our mission is to make the management of a seasonal business smoother for a family-owned pool store that both sells chemicals, pool toys, and other merchandise as well as provide service on pools to create a well-rounded business model. Our application will give a real-time view of inventory and contractor management so that data can be seen and acted upon by managers with ease. This will improve efficiency within the business, reduce costs for contractors, and improve relationships between the business and its customers by fulfilling projects in a time-efficient manner.
